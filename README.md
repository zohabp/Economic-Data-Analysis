# 🧮 U.S. Unemployment and Labor Participation Analysis (2020–2022)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project uses **Python and Jupyter Notebook** to analyze U.S. economic data — specifically **unemployment rates** and **labor force participation rates** — around the onset of the **COVID-19 pandemic**.  
The analysis retrieves data directly from the **Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)** API and focuses on **April 2020**, when the first major economic disruptions from COVID-19 began.

## 🧹 Data Collection and Cleaning
1. **Data Source:** Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) API.  
2. **Process:**
   - Retrieved state-level unemployment and labor force participation data.   
   - Formatted the data with consistent monthly frequency and aligned time indexes.  
3. **Focus Period:** April 2020 onward, corresponding to the start of pandemic-related lockdowns and labor market changes.
**Analysis Approach:**  
  - Generate grid plots of all states showing unemployment and participation trends.  
  - Create a more detailed dual-axis plot for a specific state (California) to illustrate the relationship between unemployment and participation during the pandemic.
